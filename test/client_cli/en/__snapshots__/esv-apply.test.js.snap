"Usage: frodo esv apply [options] [host] [realm] [username] [password]

Apply pending changes to secrets and variables. Applying pending changes requires a restart of the AM and IDM pods and can take up to 10 minutes to complete.

Arguments:
  host                  Access Management base URL, e.g.:
                        https://cdk.iam.example.com/am. To use a connection
                        profile, just specify a unique substring.
  realm                 Realm. Specify realm as '/' for the root realm or
                        'realm' or '/parent/child' otherwise. (default: "alpha"
                        for Identity Cloud tenants, "/" otherwise.)
  username              Username to login with. Must be an admin user with
                        appropriate rights to manage authentication
                        journeys/trees.
  password              Password.

Options:
  --check-only          Check if updated need to be apply but don't apply them.
                        (default: false)
  --curlirize           Output all network calls in curl format.
  --debug               Debug output during command execution. If specified,
                        may or may not produce additional output helpful for
                        troubleshooting.
  --force               Force restart of services if no updates are found.
  -h, --help            Help
  -k, --insecure        Allow insecure connections when using SSL/TLS. Has no
                        effect when using a network proxy for https
                        (HTTPS_PROXY=http://<host>:<port>), in that case the
                        proxy must provide this capability. (default: Don't
                        allow insecure connections)
  -m, --type <type>     Override auto-detected deployment type. Valid values
                        for type:
                        classic:  A classic Access Management-only deployment

                        forgeops: A ForgeOps CDK or CDM deployment.
                        The detected or provided deployment type controls
                        certain behavior like obtaining an Identity Management
                        admin token or not and whether to export/import
                        referenced email templates or how to walk through the
                        tenant admin login flow of Identity Cloud and handle
                        MFA (choices: "classic", "cloud", "forgeops")
